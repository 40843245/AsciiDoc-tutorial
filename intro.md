# AsciiDoc
## Intro
AsciiDoc is a human-readable document format,

semantically equivalent to DocBook XML, 

but using plain-text mark-up conventions. 

AsciiDoc documents can be created using any text editor and read “as-is”, 

or rendered to HTML or any other format supported by a DocBook tool-chain, i.e. PDF, TeX, Unix manpages, e-books, slide presentations, etc. 

Common file extensions for AsciiDoc files are txt (as encouraged by AsciiDoc's creator) and adoc.

## File extension

> [!NOTE]
> In `AsciiDoc`, file extension: `txt`, `adoc`,`asciidoc`.
>
> Commonly used file extension: `txt`.
